<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>Texture Synthesis is method in 2d procedural generation that is quickly becoming and interest for several developers.  Its capability can easily be be extended to 3d.  This is an active investigation on how to teach a computer to output generated content from sample input.  The general basis is discussed <a href='http://graphics.stanford.edu/papers/texture-synthesis-sig00/' target="_blank">HERE</a></p>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>I will attempt to make different methods of generation based with and without my Das_Noise Library and will later include research on this topic in GLSL.  The eventual goal is to create a robust texture synthesis library for javascript and use this product to aid in the deployment of TERIABLE.
The initial test will be loosely based on the documentation and will be my own spin on the approach. Later I with lessons learned will attempt to deploy more popular methods.
The outcome of these test I am unsure of but will document both the approach and the results and provide an example.
</p>
<h2>Test 1</h2>
<p>The first test was trying to not deploy a base noise to reference the sample texture against.  I stopped working on this test after i started noticing shortcomings in the colors being produced.</p>
